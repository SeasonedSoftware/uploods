![npm bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/min/uploods)

A package with components for file uploads.

## Installation

```
yarn add uploods
```

If you want to use "upload on drop", also install firebase.
```
yarn add firebase
```

### Storage host

#### Firebase setup

You need two things: An api key and a bucket link.

Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/

##### Create a project
1. Click "Add project" or "Create project", whichever appears to you
2. Choose a name for the project
3. Uncheck "Activate Google Analytics" if you only want to use storage
4. Click "Create project"

##### Create a web app for the project to get an API key
1. Click the project you just created under "Your Firebase projects". You should be at "https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/<your-project>/overview"
2. Under you app name, click "Add app" or choose the Web option under "Start adding Firebase to your app".
3. Choose a name for your web app. Uncheck "Configure Firebase hosting for this app".
4. Click Register app
5. Firebase will load "Add Firebase SDK" and show its full script.
6. Copy your `apiKey` to use in your env vars. You can disregard the rest if you're using only storage.
  
```
...

<script>
  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  var firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "api-key",
    ...
  };
  // Initialize Firebase
  firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
</script>
```

##### Configure storage to get a Bucket URL
1. Go back to the overview console
2. Click "Develop" on the side bar
3. Click "Storage"
4. Click "First steps"
5. A dialog will open with security rules. Click "Next".
6. Cloud store location: By default, choose `us-east-1`. That one is included in the Spark plan, the free one.
7. Click "Finish" and wait for it to create your default bucket.
8. It will redirect you to your bucket. The URL is like `https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/<your-project>/storage/<your-bucket>/files`
9. On the `Files` tab, copy the bucket link: `gs://<your-bucket-id>.appspot.com`. Use that link to identify your bucket.
10. Go to `Rules` tab and edit the rules to enable read, write to all.
```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write;
    }
  }
}
```
11. Publish the rules. Note that Firebase doesn't recommend using these settings for production.
